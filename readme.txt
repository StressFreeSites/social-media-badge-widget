This plugin creates a widget which easily displays the social badges from the leading social media websites in a clear an elegant way.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget which easily displays the social badges from the leading social media websites (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn, You Tube, Pinterest and Flickr) in a clear and elegant way.

It displays the information in an accordion, so only one section is open at a time, which ensures your website does not become cluttered visually.

The plugin includes a plugin admin page where it is possible to customise everything from the social media channel to the visual styling of the accordion.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get all the code from the social media websites? =

You do not need to! The code is automatically created, all you need is the name of you profile on each social media channel.

= What is the width option on the widget? =

The width option sets the width, if possible, of the embedded social media channel information so that it appears at the correct width for you website. This should be set to the width of the widget in the sidebar.

= Can social media channels be hidden? =

Yes, just do not enter any information for that social media channel and that section will not show up.
