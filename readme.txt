This plugin creates a widget which easily displays, without becoming cluttered, the social badge from the leading social media websites.

== Description ==

This plugin creates a widget which easily displays the social badge from the leading social media websites (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn and You Tube).

It displays the information in an accordion, so only one section is open at a time, which ensures your website does not become cluttered visually.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload `social-media-badge-widget` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the `Social Media Badge Widget` plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to widgets and add the `Social Media Badge Widget` to your sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where do I get all the code from the social media websites? =

You do not need to! The code is automatically created, all you need is the name of you profile on each social media channel.

= What is the width option on the widget? =

The width option sets the width, if possible, of the embedded social media channel information so that it appears at the correct width for you website. This should be set to the width of the widget in the sidebar.

= Can social media channels be hidden? =

Yes, just do not enter any information for that social media channel and that section will not show up.
